That might have felt like a strange mail, but it was routine to the developers who lived through it

This was exactly the kind of friction that forced better tools into existence.

To understand why, we need to go back to a time when computers were still strange boxes that took their time “thinking”

## Mail and Pendrive Era

![pre-vcs-mailing](https://res.cloudinary.com/djsasyvfl/image/upload/v1768262822/git-part-1-hero_lmefug.png)


Picture yourself, a young enthusiastic nerd in the 90s, sitting in front of your [IBM PC clone](https://web.archive.org/web/19981205221105/https://www.abc.se/~m9339/linux/linuxdoc/linuxnews03a.html){:target="_blank"} running Minix. You and you friends are working on a fun project [Freax](https://lwn.net/Articles/325056/){:target="_blank"}

You know a guy who really knows his way around MASM so you drop a mail asking for help. He is onboard, you send him the code zip over mail and so the collaboration begins. Life goes on, your project is being talked about on IRC Channels and before anyone knows, tens of people are sending over their patches for this revolutionary new software


> - You send `latest.zip` to Dennis
> - Dennis reverts with an updated `parser.c`
> - You manually pick and choose changes to keep, compile and run
> - Guido is joining as a new contributor so Tim sends him `project.zip`
> - You notify Tim about the updated parser, send him the `latest_really.zip`
> - Here comes Bjarne wholly persuaded by Richard's take on Libre Licensing and now we suddenly have `I_Love_Libre.zip`


The issue is glaringly obvious.

**THERE IS NO ORGANIZATION IN THE CODEBASE**


Everyone has their own version of the truth.
This is where early version control systems enter the picture.

## Early Version Control Systems

### Centralized VCS

- There is one central repository that everyone depends on (Source of Truth)
- You need to be connected to the server in order to make changes
- Each developer gets a working copy, not the full repository
- History is on central server

#### CVS

There is chatter about version control and there exists this software named CVS. You start using CVS with the help of your friend [Ari](https://www.w3.org/Tools/findrefs.pl.html){:target="_blank"}

Now you have one server hosting the Project. Workflow looks something like this:

1. **Copy project from Server**
```bash
cvs checkout project
```
    Everyone has a local copy on your computer BUT meaningful actions still depend on the server
    You start modifying `main.c` on your local FS.

    There is no lock on files. Someone changed `main.c` while you were working on it and committed before you? Well, tough luck


2. **Update before committing**
```bash
cvs update
```
    This the stage where you pull changes from the server (yea change first, pull later)

    Remember your `main.c` changes? They are currently in conflict with latest at server. You have to manually pick and choose changes to keep

3. **Commit**
```bash
cvs commit
```
    After resolving conflicts, you commit your changes.
    Each file is committed independently - if something fails midway, you can end up with a partially applied change.

#### SVN

Someone on the IRC suggested Subversion so you decides to give it a try!

The workflow stayed similar


1. **Copy project from Server**
```bash
svn checkout project
```

2. **Lock file if you want**
```bash
svn lock main.c -m "Editing civilization"
```
    {: file="Optional" }

    You can edit the file locally. Others can still modify it locally, but they cannot commit changes while the lock is held.

3. **Commit**
```bash
svn commit main.c -m "Update civilization"
```
    Now you can commit changes atomically. Some improvement finally!

4. **Unlock the File**
```bash
svn unlock main.c
```
    The file is now available for someone else

#### Issues with Centralized VCS

1. The server is a Single Point of Failure
2. History is stored on the server making your working copy incomplete
3. Branching while Technically Possible, is expensive

### Distributed VCS

- No central server (No source of Truth)
- Every local copy is a Full Repository including history and branches
- Branches are Lightweight and Cheap making it part of workflow

#### BitKeeper

Freax has become widespread. Hundreds of contributors and Thousands of lines of code

CVS and SVN don’t scale to this level so you decided to go Distributed

Bitkeeper is a famous DVCS but it is proprietary. Alas! the project needs it so you compromise and start using it

The catch is the license. Contributors are explicitly forbidden from reverse-engineering BitKeeper,
and violating this condition means losing access entirely.


Latest workflow is something like this

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
bk clone bk://freax.bkbits.net/freax-2.5 freax
cd freax
```
    You have a full repo copy with all history and branches

2. **Make Changes Locally**

    Edit the files you want to change. No need to manually Lock and Unlock files. No connection to the server


3. **Commit Changes**
```bash
bk commit
```
    Commits were local and Atomic

4. **Pull Changes**
```bash
bk pull
```
    Pull changes from others. This might create conflict


5. **Resolve Conflicts**

    BitKeeper knew which changes conflicted so conflict resolution was easier

    Merges had explicit Record making it traceable


6. **Push Changes**
```bash
bk push
```
    Your changes are now available to others. Contributors choose if they want to pull changes or not

#### A new beginning

Freax now depends on a proprietary tool, governed by a license that could be revoked at any time.

For a project built on open collaboration, that dependency could not last...
