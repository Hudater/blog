The speed makes for a good legend, but what’s worth appreciating is the engineering behind it. The design goal behind Git was straightforward: fast, simple, and precise To understand these design decisions and the quirky behavior of Git, we need to understand the .git directory and not just memorize command...</summary> </entry> <entry><title>Git for Beginners: Basics and Essential Commands (2/3)</title><link href="https://blog.hudater.dev/posts/git-part-2/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Git for Beginners: Basics and Essential Commands (2/3)" /><published>2026-01-14T00:00:00+05:30</published> <updated>2026-01-23T19:30:39+05:30</updated> <id>https://blog.hudater.dev/posts/git-part-2/</id> <content type="text/html" src="https://blog.hudater.dev/posts/git-part-2/" /> <author> <name>Harshit Mani Tripathi</name> </author> <category term="git-series" /> <category term="vcs" /> <summary>… The dependency didn’t last.
